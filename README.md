Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe and Firewatch are two notable indie games that have received significant attention for their unique approaches to storytelling and gameplay.
While they share some similarities in their narrative-driven structures they diverve in their specific implementations, offering distinct experiences for players.

1. Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe:
	* Self-aware narrator: The narrator in Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe is a pivotal component, serving as a constant commentary on the player's actions and the game's narrative. This self-awareness blurs the lines between the game world and the real world, inviting players to question the nature of their experience. The narrator's manipulation of the game's progression challenges the player's sense of agency, suggesting that their choices may be predetermined or irrelevant.
	  
	* Multiple endings: The game's multiple endings are a direct consequence of the player's choices throughout the narrative. This feature reinforces the illusion of player agency while also highlighting the limitations of choice within a predetermined framework. The endings can vary wildly, from humorous to tragic, demonstrating the narrator's ability to shape the player's experience.
	  
	* Timelines and alternate realities: The introduction of timelines and alternate realities adds a layer of complexity to the game's narrative. These elements challenge the player's understanding of causality and the nature of reality. By exporting different possibilities, the game invites players to consider the implications of their choices and the potential consequences of their actions.
	  
	* Meta-narrative structure: The game's meta-narrative structure, constantly reflecting on its own existence as a game, is a defining feature. This self-awareness forces players to question the nature of storytelling and the role of the player in shaping the narrative. By breaking the fourth wall, the game invites players to become more conscious of their own participation in the experience.
	  
	* Limited gameplay mechanics: While Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe offers limited gameplay mechanics, its focus of narrative and player choice is intentional. The game's simplicity allows the narrative to take centre stage, preventing distractions and ensuring that the player's attention is fully engaged. This minimalist approach also highlights the importance of storytelling in video games, demonstrating that a compelling narrative can be more engaging than complex gameplay mechanics.
	  
2. Firewatch:
   * Open-world environment: The vast explorable wilderness of Firewartch provides players with a sense of freedom and isolation. The game's open-world design encourages exploration and discovery, allowing players to uncover hidden secrets and piece together the story's mysteries at their own pace. The environment also serves as a metaphor for the protagonist's internal struggles, reflecting his feeling of loneliness and isolation.
	 
   * Character interactions: The interactions between Henry and other characters in Firewatch add depth and complexity to the narrative. These interactions provide valuable insights into the characters' lives and motivations, helping players to connect with them on a personal level. The relationships that Henry forms also contribute to the game's themes of friendship, trust and misdirection.
	 
   * Environmental storytelling: Firewatch's use of environmental storytelling is a key component of its narrative. The game's visual cues, audio and environmental details provide clues and information about the story's events and characters. By carefully observing the world around them, Ppalyers can piece together the puzzle and uncover the truth behind the mysterious occurrences in the park.
	 
   * Puzzle-solving elements: While not the primary focus of Firewatch, the puzzle-solving elements add a layer of challenge and engagement. These puzzles often require players to use their observation and problem-solving skills to overcome obstacles and progress through the story. The puzzles are designed to be integrated into the narrative, providing opportunities for players to learn more bout the game's world and characters.
	 
   * Survival mechanics: The survival mechanics in Firewatch add a sense of realism and danger to the game's setting. Players must manage their resources, stay hydrated, and avoid getting lost in the wilderness. These mechanics create a sense of urgency and tension, forcing players to be mindful of their surroundings and make careful decisions.

3. A critical analysis based on design principles:
	1. Narrative design:
		* Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe excels in its use of meta-narrative, challenging the player's expectations and forcing them to question the nature of their experience. The game's narrator serves as a constant reminder of the artificiality of the game world, inviting players to reflect on the limitations of linear storytelling.
		  
		* Firewatch prioritises environmental storytelling, using the game's settings to convey its themes of isolation and loneliness. The vast wilderness serves as an encounter to reflect his search for meaning in life
	2. Gameplay Design
		* Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe primarily relies on player choice and exploration. While the game offers limited gameplay mechanics, its focus on narrative and player agency makes it a compelling experience
		  
		* Firewatch offers a more traditional gameplay experience, combining exploration, puzzle solving and character interactions. The game's open-world environment encourages exploration and discovery, while the character interactions provide a sense of connection and human intimacy.
	3. Player agency
		* Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe offers players a high degree of agency, allowing them to shape the narrative through their choices. However, the game's self-aware narrator constantly reminds players of the limitations of their agency, suggesting that their choices are ultimately predetermined
		  
		* Firewatch provides players with a sense of agency through exploration and decision-making. While the game's narrative is largely linear, players can choose how they approach the story and interact with the environment.
	  
4. Conclusion:
	* Both Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe and Firewatch are exceptional examples of narrative driven games that offer unique and engaging experiences. While they share similarities in their focus on storytelling, their approaches to narrative, gameplay, and player agency differ significantly. Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe excels in its meta-narrative and exploration of player agency, while Firewatch offers a more grounded and immersive experience through its environmental storytelling and character interactions. Ultimately, the choice between these two games depends on the player's preferences for narrative style and gameplay mechanics.

5. Inspiration taken from these games:
   	 * I'm drawn to Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe's simplistic yet detailed gameplay, being that there are very few actual gameplay mechanics but the storytelling is so in-depth and easy to follow that the player gets sucked into the game anyway.
   	 * Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe's narrator also intrigued me, I liked the idea of having a third party try to persuade the player's choices to their own to give the player a harder time making decisions whilst also allowing the player to follow the creator's pathway.
   	 * Firewatch does a great job at developing the characters around the player, each choice adds its own characteristic to that character and can change the encounters with them further into the game.
   	 * Undertale has a great narrative and I liked the character "Sans" because his goal is to kill the human but he's too playful so he decides to deceive the human into thinking he's a good guy and ends up trying to kill him later in the game.

6. Branching choices:

7. Level design:
	 * I decided to design some of my levels to have their own branching decision, the very first level (not the tutorial) contains its own branching decision within it, by choosing to either go down the hole or parkour up to the sheep, the player makes a massive split in the narrative of the game

8. Dialogue choices:

Testing Feedback:
| Person      | Issue | Solution     | Comments |
| :---:       |    :----:   |    :----:     |     :----:    |
| Ethan Perkins | No Background | The free asset pack I'm using provides backgrounds so I can just use those | "I want to feel more immersed in the game experience and by not having a background I felt like the character was just wandering on a floating island" |
| Ethan Perkins | Stamina is too overpowered, there is also a bug with the stamina, while the game is paused stamina will still replenish or deplete | The stamina bar should go down while walking and go down even faster when sprinting, when the bar is completely depleted it should also have a wait time before refilling and the player should be almost completely hindered from movement while out of stamina, also the timers that deal with the stamina just need to be paused along with the game | "Being able to run so fast everywhere around the map felt too overpowered" |
| Ethan Perkins | No way to kill the NPCs | When the NPCs hate status rating goes below -1 an option will appear in certain scenarios that allow the player to kill them | "If the NPC dislikes you so much to the point where they are getting in your way, you should be able to kill them and it's unfair if you can't" |
| Ethan Perkins | Returning to the main menu breaks the main menu | This issue was caused by the game being paused when returning to the main menu, to fix this I set the process mode of the main menu to "Allways Active", I also unpause the game when changing to the main menu | "This bug is so stupid, it hinders you from being able to do anything when you return to the main menu PLEASE fix this" |
| Ethan Perkins | Slots don't work | I can use the save script from my previous assessment to create a save system and use that for my slots | "You should either remove the multiple slots and just have one working one" |
| Ethan Perkins | Add the fastest time to an ending on the front | I can start a timer from when the player gets into the game and stop the timer when the player exits to the main menu or pauses the game, then I just have to compare the times to the other slots times and display the lowest time on the front | "Displaying the time played on the slots is good for speedrunning purposes but it would be cooler to display the fastest time on the front" |
| Ethan Perkins | Add a map because there are locations mentioned in dialogue but not shown anywhere in the game | I will draw up a map in Microsoft Paint and display it when either an input is pressed or always in the top right | "The map should show the locations to give the player more immersion into the world your creating" |
| Blake Rushworth | Put Jefferey in the wall, like a cave | I can just change the tilemap and place Jefferey where I need him | "This makes the parkour seem way less out of place" |

11. How I've implemented branching decisions:
	 * 
 
12. How these new skills could be transferable:
	 * I believe that every skill I have learnt on this project can be transferable to every other project I do in the future. A branching decision doesn't have to be exclusive to dialogue, it is everywhere, even with movement controls the player is making a branching decision of whether to move left, right, up or down depending on the game. Branching decisions can also be used for things like enemy AI and skill trees, the list goes on. Because I created my own Dialogue system I can also use that in future projects and tweak it to that project's use case.
	 * Branching decisions are also not exclusive to games, they can be used in things like websites, data storage, analytical software and more, this skill set is widely transferable across all realms of programming not just restricted to game development.
	
Optional Tutorial (Not included in word count. Opening the raw file is required for indentation purposes):
How to:
  Dialogue System:
	The Dialogue system can be used with the understanding of a few keys.
	To make a character say something, put a "-" before the character name then 
	indent everything you want the character to say like this:
	-Cameron
	  	I am Cameron
	  	I like to eat
	To make a character ask a question you need to put a "?" at the end of the line that will ask the question,
	then indent all the options you want the player to have access to like this:
	-Cameron
		What would you like to eat?
		   Soup
		   Pasta
		   Pizza
	You can also expand on this by adding new paths indented after a selected option like this:
	-Cameron
	  	What would you like to eat?
		 Soup
		   -Friend
			 Yeah that sounds good
		 Pasta
		   -Friend
			 Hm I don't really like pasta
		 Pizza
		   -Friend
			 No comment
	If you want to have the "tree_finished" signal emmited with an integer you can do
	< and then the integer you want emitted, it will look like this
	<1
	the default for this argument is 0

Story (Still not included in word count):
	A young kid gets bullied throughout all of their life for their looks, the kid then resorts to violence and kills his bullies, this causes the local people to exile him through a portal, this story follows the now hooded kid to hide his looks, finding his way back home to finish what he started.
